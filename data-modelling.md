# Data modelling

The intention is to separate the NPQ application from ECF so that NPQ can operate standalone.

In order to do that we need to move NPQ data from the ECF app to the NPQ one. This document
will propose a model for storing that data.

The aim is:

* not to introduce anything unnecessary to NPQ
* to structure the data so it's easy to understand
* the queries that power the API should be simple and fast

## Current schema

* Everything hangs off the `Application`
* The foreign keys aren't currently enforced at the database level, we aim to
  fix that before building anything on top (thanks Pablo! ðŸ˜„)

### Things we merged

[See data integrity](./data-integrity.md).

### Things we intend to change

* use `course_id` as the foreign key between `applications` and `courses` instead of `identifier`

### Things we removed

#### Policy-specific prefixes

When sharing a database with ECF there were several tables and columns that had
to be qualified with either `ecf_` or `npq_`. When separated, the prefixes are 
superfluous and can be dropped entirely.

| Old                  | New              |
| ---                  | ---              |
| `npq_lead_providers` | `lead_providers` |
| `npq_courses`        | `courses`        |

#### ParticipantIdentity, TeacherProfile and ParticipantProfile

Completing ECF takes two years and during that time the participant's circumstances
can change many times. Not all past details about a participant are visible to
their current provider, and their current details aren't visible to their past
providers.

To cope with this complex set of requirements ECF employs a hierarchy of ownership.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    users ||--o{ participant_identities : "has_many"
    participant_identities ||--|{ participant_profiles : "has many"
    users ||--|| teacher_profiles : "has one"
    participant_profiles ||--o{ induction_records : ""
    participant_identities ||--|{ npq_applications : ""

    users {
        string full_name
        string email
    }

    teacher_profiles {
        string trn
    }

    participant_identities {
        string email
    }

    participant_profiles {
        string type "NPQ, ECT or Mentor"
    }
```

This hierarchy is more complicated than necessary for NPQ.

NPQ is a much simpler process. An application is made once by the teacher
themselves. We don't need to worry about ownership or restricting access via
the API. We can probably simply allow applications to `belong_to` a user
directly.

```mermaid
erDiagram

    users ||--o{ npq_applications : "makes"
    users ||--o{ email_addresses : "has many"
    users {
        string full_name
        string trn
    }
    email_addresses {
        string email_address
    }
```

## Questions

### Do we use NPQ-style numeric IDs for primary keys or switch to UUIDs?

### Should we store some data in multiple locations (eg: `application.user_id` == `application.declarations.user_id`), we can also refer to it through the parent association and be better normalised?

We agree that removing any unnecessary fields and normalising the database as much as possible is a good idea.
